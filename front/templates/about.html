      <p style="color:black;">	Every year a large number of people give entrance examinations and it is a really tough job to crack the entrance examination. So many of them go to learning institutions where they can be well prepared. Going to institution at the particular time just wastes time for travelling from home to institution and again back to home .It may also not be possible for all the people to join institution who resides far away from learning institution. So to overcome those drawbacks of the existing old fashioned system we require a system which can make the preparation virtually with the help of app. Entrance Preparation is the online platform that helps to prepare for various entrance exams virtually. It is really a powerful system in which a large number of people can be connected to gain knowledge on the topics of their choice and make them well practice for their entrance. In this system people can find the past question papers . Also quizzes and dummy entrance exams can be conducted in this app which builds up confidence for giving real entrance exam .There is also evaluation scheme which shows how well he/she is prepared for entrance exam and this evaluation is based on the his/her performance in the dummy exams. As this app allows anyone to prepare for the entrance exam from their home at any time, it really saves time and makes the preparation more efficient.</p>
